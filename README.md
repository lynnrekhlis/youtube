I’m Lynn. In my spare time, I am an award-winning, Dallas-based wedding photographer and professional groomsmen wrangler.

You can follow along on the [Lynn Michelle Photography YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lynnmichellephoto) to find real-life wedding photography adventures, behind-the-scenes silliness, and answers to all your burning questions about photography ... from someone who's been doing this for 25 years — and still mostly loves it.

Come for the pretty pictures. Stay for the sarcasm (and the technical details, because I love those!)
